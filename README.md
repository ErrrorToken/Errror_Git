# Errror_Git - $ ERRROR (ERRR) Token repo
$ ERRROR (ERRR) is a BEP20 token on Binance Smart Chain.

"Legend has it that some developers, tired of continuous scams, wanted to create a token to scam others in return, but something went orribly wrong ...

During the deployment a big mistake occurred and the token became irreversibly honest and fair. OMG!

It was too late for the evil developers, as they had already renounced the ownership and burned the whole LP, so $ ERRROR was now driven by the community.
For ever and ever."
